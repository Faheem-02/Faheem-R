A fresh graduate AI/ML Engineer with hands-on experience in geospatial data and remote sensing.  
I believe AI should act as a partner to enhance human work, creativity, and problem-solving.  

Inspired by **Pranav Mistry’s SixthSense**, I aim to design AI systems that augment human creativity, not replace it.  
Passionate about reverse engineering problems, researching deeply, and exploring creative alternatives to make processes smarter and more effective.

## 🚀 Featured Projects
- **[LULC Semantic Segmentation](https://github.com/Faheem-02/LULC-Classification-U-Net-ResNet34)**  
  U-Net for classifying satellite imagery (Buildings, Woodlands, Water). ISRO internship project—enhanced data pipelines for rare classes.  

- **[Image Super-Resolution](https://github.com/Faheem-02/Comparative-Study-of-Deep-Learning-Models-for-Image-Super-Resolution)**  
  Compared SRCNN, SRGAN on satellite images. GANs outperformed CNNs (higher PSNR/SSIM). Focus: Sharpening geospatial data for better analysis.  

- **[U-Net + ResNet34 Extension](https://github.com/Faheem-02/LULC-Classification-U-Net-ResNet34)**  
  Independent boost of ISRO internship to baseline U-Net—0.7+ Mean IoU via augmentation and backbone integration.
